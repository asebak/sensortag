This is the unmodifed android source code from TI. 
TI makes it ridiculously hard and annoying to get the source, 
you have to download an executable (which only works on windows, 
so if you want android source on a mac, it doesn't work, and the 
linux files have issues), so I decided to download it, 
and just extract the source code. The code belongs to TI and their
licenes still applies. Check their website or the license etc.
